Many software visualizations have been proposed to help stakeholders identify potential threats in the design of evolving software systems, often employing metaphors such as trees, graphs, constellations, maps, and cities, among others. In this scenario, three-dimensional visualizations have also been adopted. They can represent visual metaphors realistically and efficiently engage users. However, the interaction with such visualizations is either cumbersome or requires expensive equipment. This paper presents SkyscrapAR, an augmented reality visualization that employs the city metaphor to represent evolving software, along with its potential applications in the practice. The use of augmented reality allows the user to interact with the city in an intuitive way, by manipulating a maker, while requiring nothing but a computer and an inexpensive camera to make it work.
