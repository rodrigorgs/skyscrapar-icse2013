Many authors have proposed three-dimensional visualizations to assist in the understanding and development of software. However, it is not natural to navigate through such visualizations using keyboard and mouse, and equipment such as virtual reality gloves and glasses are too expensive. In this paper we present SkyscrapAR, an augmented reality visualization that uses the city metaphor to represent the evolution of the software, along with its potential applications in practice. The use of augmented reality allows the user to interact with the city in an intuitive way by manipulating a marker printed on a paper. The hardware requirements are minimal: just a computer with a camera. Such features make SkyscrapAR a good fit for design reviews either within the workplace or in a videoconference setting.
